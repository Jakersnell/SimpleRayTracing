# ray-tracer
A simple Ray-Tracer written in Rust.
This project has been a lot of fun, hope you enjoy it as much as I do.

ultimate goals for this project, in no real order:
1. To render scenes composed of complex materials:
    Glass, Metal, Matte, Rubber, Ceramic, Mirror.
2. Apply modern image effects:
    Motion blur, antialiasing, depth of field, etc.
3. Depict light behavior in different mediums:
    Fog, Atmosphere, Dusty air, vacuum.
4. Use different shapes, and more complex polygon meshes:
    Triangles, Square planes, Spheres, Cubes, Pyramids.
5. Implement Mapped textures.
6. Allow for Import and use of Blender Models.
7. implement simple 3D modeler in python.
